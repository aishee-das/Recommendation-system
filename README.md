# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### Algorithm Builder: Social Media Feed Game
Welcome to the Algorithm Builder, an interactive educational game that teaches young users how social media algorithms work by letting them build and customise their own!

Purpose:
This project is designed to raise awareness and critical thinking around how online content is ranked and recommended, specifically within social media platforms. Players are guided through a series of questions that help them understand how algorithms can use factors like likes, follows, hashtags, recency, and paid promotion to determine what content appears on their feed.

Gameplay Overview:
Choose Your Profile
Players begin by selecting a character profile. Each one has unique interests and follows different users and hashtags.

Customize the Algorithm
The player is presented with a series of questions across different pages, such as:

How many likes does the post have?

Does the user follow the poster?

Are any followed hashtags used?

How recent is the post?

Has the content been promoted?

Adjust Importance
Each question allows the player to assign a weight (importance) to that factor on a scale of 0â€“10.

Enter Values
The player inputs values for each factor (e.g. number of likes, time since posted).

Score Breakdown
A running breakdown on the right-hand side calculates the score live, showing how each factor contributes to the final score.

See Results & Reflect
Players can reflect on how small changes (like a paid promotion or a recent post) can drastically affect what they see online.
